On Figure 1 below an investigation has ben made on whether the type of car involved in the crash has any importance. The three most often appearing types of car (station wagon, sedan and passenger vehicle) must be assumed to also be the type of transportation with the highest density in the city. At least it is of no surprise that these appear more often than taxies as an example.

What is interesting on the plot below is that some vehicles have few crashes in the weekends. Looking closer it seems, that what these vehicles have in common, is that they are all bigger sized vehicles such as *'box truck'*, *'bus'*, *'pick-up truck'*, *'tractor truck diesel'* and *'van'*. The reason for this could be that these cars are mainly related to when people are working, therefor higher in the weekdays.
