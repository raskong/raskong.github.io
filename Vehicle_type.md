On Figure 1 below an investigation has ben made on whether the type of car involved in the crash has any importance. The three most often appearing types of car (station wagon, sedan and passenger vehicle) must be assumed to also be the type of transportation with the highest density in the city. At least it is of no surprise that these appear more often than taxies as an example.

Looking at all the vehicle types individually and then investigating which day of the week most car crashes happen, it appears that some vehicles have few crashes in the weekends (Figure 2). Looking closer it seems, that what these vehicles have in common, is that they are all bigger sized vehicles such as *'box truck'*, *'bus'*, *'pick-up truck'*, *'tractor truck diesel'* and *'van'*. The reason for this could be that these cars are mainly related to when people are working, therefor higher in the weekdays.

Below (Figure 3V) we can see a how the count of crashes is distributied when the Contributing factor is paired with the veihcle type. When looking at the data the plot presents, we once agian we see some odd patterns around the vehicle type "passenger vehicle" where we have a counts of zero in the contributing factors "alcohol involment", "unsafe speed" and more. it was Earlier pointed out that the posibility of "passenger vecihle" had been fully or partly shifted out with "sedan". This could still be true, but then it looks like there also have been a change in the process of noting down the contributing factors.
