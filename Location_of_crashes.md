### Most unsafe postal codes 
Although the number of car accidents is largely related to human factors and errors, it is also interesting to look at the city planning itself. It is not inconceivable that the structure of the roads and architechture of the city could be to blame for the factors. 
On Figure 1, you can see a count of the number of car accidents between 2013 and 2023 divided into NYC's Postal Codes.

A relatively even distribution is seen here, with the exception of postal code 11236 (Canarsie|Brooklyn) and an increased concentration around Manhattan and the transition to Queens. 
The reason why Canarsie is more exposed to car crashes could be that this covers the Broadway Junction where thw two big roads; Broadway and Atlantic Avenue meets, while Manhatan is the most densely populated borough of NYC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan, accessed 30-04-2024) which also could cause more frequent crashes.


### Specific roads
Another interesting factor for car accidents is the rest roads they take place on. On Figure 2, you can see the 10 roads where accidents most often occur.

</figure>

Here it can be seen how there is an immediate connection with the fact that it is New York's largest and longest roads, such as Broadway, which appear most frequently in reports of car accidents. 
This is to be expected as more accidents will likely occur on a longer road. It is however important to be aware of that this might not indicate that it is statistically more dangerous to be on the road. To get an accurate evaluation of the chances of participating in a crash you would have to divide the number of drivers on the road with the number of crashes. In this analysis this approach havenâ€™t been prioritized - but could be suggested as future work in a more in depth analysis. 



### Heatmap
From the analysis of "Vehicle type" we found that stationcars were especially unsafe when it comes to the frequency of crashes. On the heatmap on Figure 3 it is visualized where in NYC stationcars most often result in crashes where at least one person is killed.

</figure>
Overall, the density of fatal crashes is fairly evenly distributed all over NYC. Some areas/locations do however have more reported crashes as the ones displayed in Figure 3. These often have in common that they are either located around large roads or in densely populated areas. 

### Conclusion on location of crashes. 
After having conducted an analysis of where the crashes (both fatal and non-fatal) happen in NYC, it is fair to conclude that no unexpected patterns appear. It can be concluded that crashes most often appear, when it either is a very densely populated area or you are on a big road/the intersection of several.
