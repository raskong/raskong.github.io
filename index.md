### Introduction
This page concerns car crashes in New York City (NYC) from mid 2012 until 2024. It is based on the dataset ‚ÄúMotor vehicle collisions - crashes‚Äù. (Link til kilde m√•ske?)
It contains over 2 million data points with 29 different attributes covering date, time and location (both coordinates, streetname and cross street name).
Also number of people (drivers, pedestrians, cyclists) injuerd or killed as well as the contributing factor for the crash and the vehicle types involved are included.

To make it easy for you to navigate through the data we have divided the analysis in three sub groups. 
Firstly a more general data overview as well as two focus areas: the contributing factors for the crashes and the vehicle types involved in the crash.

Different types of plots will make the story eaiser for you to navigate in the content.

Please see the panes in the top to navigate through the different sections.

Alembic is a starting point for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) projects. Rather than starting from scratch, this boilerplate is designed to get rolling immediately. Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it.

3. Add `theme: alembic-jekyll-theme` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
5. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add `gem "jekyll-remote-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
